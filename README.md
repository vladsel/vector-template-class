# vector-template-class

(06.06.2021) A template of classes of an abstract data structure with a definition of specified functions and operations (a copy constructor and an assignment operation are defined in the template class) and
corresponding class diagram. Wrote a test program that verifies the use of the template for standard data types using the example of a vector.

Template vector classes for saving elements of arbitrary type. The size of the vector and the size of its maximum expansion
are specified as constructor arguments.
Vector empty check function.
A function that returns the number of elements in a vector.
Vector formation function.
Sorting function of vector elements.
A function that returns the first element of a vector.
A function that returns the last element of a vector.
The function of adding an element to the end of a vector.
The function to delete (without returning a value) an element from
the end of the vector (if the vector is empty, then a corresponding message should be displayed).
An indexing operation that returns an element of a vector (if the index value does not belong to the range of the vector, then a corresponding message should be output).
The operation of outputting elements of a vector to a stream.
